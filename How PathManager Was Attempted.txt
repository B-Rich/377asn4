How PathManager Was Attempted

1. Refactored original PathManager into a singleton; attached it to Game, detached it from Weebles
2. Moved OnPathRequest method into FindPath method, replacing it with just enqueueing the incoming request
3. On every update, PathManager checks if the queue.length > 1, then dequeue and perform FindPath on that EventData
